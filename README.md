## What is AI Text Fixer?

AI Text Fixer is a lightweight Chrome extension that improves the readability of ChatGPT responses by replacing AI-generated characters with more natural alternatives. It creates a more human-like reading experience by fixing special characters that often make AI-generated text feel "off" or artificial.

This is a silly simple Chrome extension that improves the readability of ChatGPT responses by replacing certain characters:

- Em dashes (`—`) → regular dashes (-)
- Curly apostrophes (`’`) → straight apostrophes (')
- Curly quotes (`“”`) → straight quotes ("")
- Ellipsis character (`…`) → three dots (...)

These special characters can create formatting issues when copied to other applications or give away that text was AI-generated. AI Text Fixer solves this problem by instantly converting these characters to their more standard alternatives with a single click.

## Does it know what I type?

Strange question but understandable. Your asking if this is sending your data anywhere, and no it’s not. I will never receive, read or have any knowledge of the data you entered into ChatGPT.

## Features

- **In-page Fix Button**: Click the AI Text Fixer button directly in each ChatGPT response
- **One-click Fixing**: Fix all responses on the page with a single click
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Extract and copy the last response as plain text with markdown formatting
- **Statistics**: See how many characters of each type were replaced
- **Works Automatically**: The extension automatically adds fix buttons to new responses as they appear
